## Under development

The ideia to consume the heartthrob-fundamentals code, that is based on [heartthrob project](https://github.com/vtnorton/heartthrob) and on [heartthrob-react](https://github.com/vtnorton/heartthrob-react), it also uses a closed source _hearrhtob-fundamentals_ to create the back end. If you want to contribute to this project, please get in touch with me and I will provide a way for you to compile it.

All the backlog for hearrthrob-fundamentals and heartthrob-fundamentals-sample is managed in this repository, feel free to read what we intend to do and to contribute in the discussion.

Initial release to be made by the end of 2021. 

A good documentation and readme file is on the way.

**This project is maitened in the develop's branch.**
